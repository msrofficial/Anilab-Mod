# Anilab Mod

**If you find this project useful, please consider giving this repository a star.**

**Anilab Mod** is a modified version of the Latest Anilab Android application designed to enhance user experience by re-enabling internal player support. This modification allows users to stream anime directly within the app without relying on external third-party video players.

**Official Website:** [anilabmod.pages.dev](https://anilabmod.pages.dev)

## About the Project

The original Anilab application currently restricts video playback, requiring users to install and use an external application called SPlayer to watch content.

**Anilab Mod** removes this dependency. It serves as an all-in-one anime hub where users can watch and download unlimited anime with no sign-up or personal information required. With thousands of titles and regular updates, this modification restores the seamless streaming experience intended for the application.

## Key Enhancement: Internal Player Support

The primary reason for this modification is to streamline the viewing process.

* **Original Behavior:** Users are forced to navigate away from the app to SPlayer to view content.
* **Mod Behavior:** Users can watch anime using the built-in internal player.

## Features

* **Internal Player Support:** Bypasses the requirement for SPlayer, allowing for native playback within the application.
* **Dual Audio Options:** Content is available in both Subbed (SUB) and Dubbed (DUB) formats to overcome language barriers.
* **Buffer-Free Streaming:** Optimized for a seamless watching experience to minimize lag and interruptions.
* **Daily Updates:** The library is updated daily with the latest episodes and titles.
* **Offline Viewing:** Supports downloading movies and shows for offline access, allowing playback without an internet connection.
* **Custom Favorites List:** Users can track and manage a personalized list of favorite anime for easy re-watching or sharing.

## Safety and Security

Anilab Mod is designed to be a safe alternative for streaming anime. It prioritizes user safety and aims to provide an immersive entertainment experience without security concerns. No sign-up or personal data is required to access the library.
